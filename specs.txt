Plain English specs

1) Compare two exactly identical one letter strings
--This is the simplest case because the two inputs are the simplest inputs possible (only 1 character each) and they are being compared in the simplest way possible (direct match, no exceptions)
Input 1: 'a'
Input 2: 'a'
Output: 1

2) Compare two different, one letter strings
--This is the next simplest case because the two inputs are the simplest inputs possible (only 1 character each) and they are being compared in a slightly more complex way (unmatched, no exceptions)
Input 1: 'a'
Input 2: 'b'
Output: 0

3) Compare one letter string to two word string
--This is the next simplest case because one of the inputs is the simplest possible and the other is not and they are being compared in a slightly more complex way (matched, with multi word search functionality)
Input 1: 'a'
Input 2: 'a b'
Output: 1

4) Compare one letter string to two word string with intraword match exception
--This is the next simplest case because one of the inputs is the simplest possible and the other is not and they are being compared in a slightly more complex way (matched, while ignoring intraword matches)
Input 1: 'a'
Input 2: 'a ab'
Output: 1

5) Compare two exactly indentical two letter strings
--This is the next simplest case because the inputs are slightly more complex but they are being compared in the simplest way possible (direct match, no exceptions)
Input 1: 'ab'
Input 2: 'ab'
Output: 1

6) Compare two different, one letter strings
--This is the next simplest case because the inputs are just as complex as the previous spec but they are being compared in a slightly more complex way (unmatched, no exceptions)
Input 1: 'ab'
Input 2: 'cd'
Output: 0

7) More than one match to source string
--This is the next simplest case because one of the inputs is the simplest possible and the other is not and they are being compared in a slightly more complex way (matched, while ignoring intraword matches), but this time with more matches (designed to make sure the app can count higher than 1)
Input 1: 'a'
Input 2: 'a b a'
Output: 2

8) More than two letters as source
--This is the next simplest case because the inputs are even more complex and they are being compared in a simpler way (matched).
Input 1: 'abcd'
Input 2: 'abcd efg hi j'
Output: 1

9) More than two matches
--This is the next simplest case because the second inputs is even more complex while returning the first to the simplest iteration and they are being compared in a slightly more complex way (matched, more than 2 matches).
Input 1: 'a'
Input 2: 'a a b a b a'
Output: 4

10) More than 2 letters as source and more than two matches
--This is the next simplest case because it combines the eighth and nineth specs in an attempt to break the app.
Input 1: 'abcd'
Input 2: 'abcd efg abcd abcd hi j abcd'
Output: 4

11) Ignore case
--This is the next simplest case because it is an exception to the normal rules with a simple solution
Input 1: 'aBcD'
Input 2: 'AbCd'
Output: 1

12) Ignore special characters in second string
--This is most complex case because it is an exceptions to the normal rules with a more complex solution
Input 1: 'abcd'
Input 2: 'Abcd!'
Output: 1
